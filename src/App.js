            <h5>1.Hangman game</h5> This project is a final version of the
            classic Hangman game developed during the course of seven days.
            Guess the correct letters to reveal a hidden word before the hangman
            is fully drawn. A fun and challenging word-guessing game that tests
            your vocabulary and deduction skills.{" "}
          </p>
          <p>
            <h5>2.Snake game </h5> A rendition of the classic Snake game where
            players control a growing snake that moves around the screen. The
            objective is to eat food to grow while avoiding collisions with the
            snake's own body and the screen's boundaries. A nostalgic and
            engaging game that requires quick reflexes.

            <h5>3.TinDog</h5> This project is the starting point for creating a
            responsive website for a fictional dog dating app called "TinDog."
            The website showcases the app's features, testimonials, and user
            interface. An imaginative project that combines design skills with
            web development to create a visually appealing and functional app
            landing page.

            <h5>4. cofee machine</h5>
            An initial implementation of a coffee machine simulation. This
            project aims to replicate the process of ordering and receiving
            coffee from a coffee machine. Users can select different types of
            coffee and customize their preferences. A practical application that
            demonstrates programming logic and decision-making.{" "}

            <h5>5. Cipher encryption</h5>
            This project involves the initial implementation of an encryption
            cipher. Encryption ciphers are algorithms used to transform plain
            text into a coded version, enhancing data security. This project
            could explore various encryption techniques and their applications.
